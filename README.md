MATLAB Files for Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP)

# How to run the scripts
To run the MATLAB scripts, one should simply type `setup.m` on the MATLAB command window.

# Explicit-MATLAB
The current DMP repository uses [Explicit-MATLAB](https://explicit-robotics.github.io/), which is an open-source robotics software that I've co-developed with [Dr. Johannes](https://jlachner.github.io/). Explicit uses differential geometry as a fundamental mathematical framework, which (in my opinion) provides a much elegant derivations of the robot's kineamtics and dynamics.
